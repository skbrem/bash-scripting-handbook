A Bash scripting handbook that I found for free through Traw on Substack.

These notes are for my own personal studying and in no way are they a substitute for the original book that I am using to create them. 

All credit goes to Traw. Check out their other stuff [here](https://thatstraw.gumroad.com/). Also highly recommend taking a look at their Substack page for some super cool Linux-related stuff [here](https://blog.sysxplore.com/).
