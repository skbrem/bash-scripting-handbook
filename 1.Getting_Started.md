## 1.1 Variables

Variables are used to assign values to variable names. For example:

`name="steve"

```bash
echo ${name} => steve # This prints a variable value
echo $name => steve # This prints a variable value
echo "$name" => steve # This prints a variable blue
echo '$name' => $name # This prints the exact string
echo "${name}!" => name! # This concatenates the variable with '!'
```

> [!tip] 
> Remember not to add a space between the variable, the equals sign, and the value. 
> 
> `name = "steve"` will cause an error.
> 
> When assigning a value, don't use the $ sign. But the $ is used when referencing the value of a variable.
> - Assigning: `name="steve"`
> - Referencing: `echo $name`

## 1.2 Comments

Comments are used to create notes about code and Bash will ignore them. To create a comment, use the # symbol.

`# This is a comment`

It's also possible to create multi-line commends in Bash using : ' to make a block.

```
: `
 a Multi-line comment made in bash
 
 Allows for adding info in blocks
`
```

Let's start with a simple Bash script:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

greet="world World
echo "$greet!, I'm new here."
# Hello world1 I'm new here
```
